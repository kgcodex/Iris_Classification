# Iris_Classification
Iris Classification Task 3 Bharat Intern 

This repository delves into the classification of Iris flower species using Python's powerful libraries:

* **Pandas:** Handles data analysis and manipulation with ease.
* **Scikit-learn:** Provides a rich toolkit for machine learning algorithms.

### Exploring the Iris Garden

The project explores the Iris dataset, a classic in machine learning. It holds information about three Iris species, each characterized by four features:

* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width

### Unveiling Patterns with Linear Regression

Linear regression, often used for prediction tasks, takes a leap into classification here. It establishes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable (species), enabling species predictions for new Iris flowers.

## Robustness through Cross-Validation

Cross-validation ensures model reliability by dividing the dataset into folds and training the model on different combinations. This approach tests model performance on unseen data, preventing overfitting and enhancing generalization.
